## Info
It is an AI/ML based tool that generates realistic excuses based on different scenarios(School,Work,Social, Family) and urgency levels (Low, Medium, High).

## What works right now:
- AI Model from HuggingFace generates unique excuse based on situation and urgency.
- CSV excuses are a fallback option if the user doesn't like the generated excuse.
- Filters excuses based on scenario and urgency.
- Returns a random excuse from the filtered set.
- Provision to add an excuse into the CSV permamnently by the user.

## What needs to be done:
- Solve the token access problem so that the user can generate text hassle free.
- Add tone customization (apologetic, formal, casual).
